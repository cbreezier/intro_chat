      <p>
        Computers would be pretty boring if they did the same thing every single time. That's why we have <b>variables</b> - literally things that vary. A <b>variable</b> can be thought of as a box - it can store a value that can <b>change</b> or <b>vary</b>.

      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        name = 'John'
        age = 3
        height = 7.89
        if (x in range(10)):
            # do something
      </pre>
